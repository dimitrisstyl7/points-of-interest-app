## Description
The Points of Interest Application is an Android mobile application designed to manage Points of Interest (POIs) for tourist destinations. The app automatically retrieves the user's current location and allows the management of POIs with attributes such as title, category, rating, geographic coordinates, photo, and description. All data is stored locally on the device using a local database.

## Features
- Automatic location detection
- CRUD operations for POIs
- Local database storage of all POI data
- Support for a single image and description per POI
- User-friendly interface for managing POIs
- Integration with the device's GPS for current location
